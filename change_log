Credits & Acknowledgements

This website was developed as a student-led, non-commercial project under a club initiative. It serves as a learning experience in web development and design, and is publicly hosted to showcase our skills and efforts. 
While we do not currently monetize this site, we acknowledge that public visibility may bring attention or recognition.

This project was developed independently, guided by insights gained through educational content and publicly available resources shared by the broader web development community. 
In particular, I’d like to acknowledge the work of:
-Codegrid
-Gravity Coding
-Olivier Larose

We do not claim ownership over their content, nor do we intend to replicate or misuse their work. Our intent is purely educational and reflective of our individual understanding and creative adaptation.
We are fully committed to acting in good faith. We will respectfully revise, update, or remove any content upon request.
